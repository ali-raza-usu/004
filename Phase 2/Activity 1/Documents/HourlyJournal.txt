1. After understaning the code, I decide to make version control message 
	1.1 I need little changes on the orginal files (core code) to includes them the version message type
2. Then I decide to create aspects
	2.1 Because it need to chanage the version of the message and no send receive message in Channels so I have to think of other ways to find use the conversion pointcut in the commJ 
	2.2 In order to change the version numbers, I need to find a method where the message is created before receiving ----> End Conversion of begin conversation
	Possible candidates: Encoder.encode , write ---
	
		2.2.1	Client is Sending a FTResquest version 1.0 but Server is expecting FTRequest version 0.0
	
		2.2.2 I have to get the contents from the existing message and create a 
	whole new message with the same contents bt a different type and version number.
3. I have found some of problem in the code design 
	3.1 control of versions 
	3.2 swapping versions to be a compatabile 
	3.3 minor changes in the aplications
4. CommJ is look like oblivious for the communication things (send/ receive/ read/ write).
5. I got another problem in the get the traget class
	1. there is some of dependecy in application-level
	2. you need to add new variables in the message, so you required to extend the Message class
6. I have some of debugging problem 
	If you can add more debugging traker point that could help the developer to debug the application and find the problem, so the developer can extend that tracker and customized it.
