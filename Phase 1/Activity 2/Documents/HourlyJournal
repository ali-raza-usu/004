1- After study the program I notecied the complecity in the code (tangling and scattering). 
2- after diagnosis the complexity in the reading and writing the message
3- we decide to use one way receive to change the version of the message ,because that provide modularity of the chanage a version of the message
	3.1 I checked the type of of receiver
	3.2 I got the message's data 
	3.3 I created new message form the type of sender
	3.4 I put the data of the received message into the new message 
4- we used one way to send to check the compatablity of the message version
